  "description": "The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission consists of two polar-orbiting satellites that are positioned in the same sun-synchronous orbit, with a phase difference of 180Â°. It aims to monitor changes in land surface conditions. The satellites have a wide swath width (290 km) and a high revisit time. Sentinel-2 is equipped with an optical instrument payload that samples 13 spectral bands: four bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-2].",
